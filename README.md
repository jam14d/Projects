# Projects Repository

# **Image Analysis**

## **Overview**
This folder contains a pipeline that automates the **processing, filtering, and statistical analysis** of whole-slide image data, focusing on **intensity and puncta detection**. It applies **outlier removal** and **adaptive thresholding** to refine raw data and extract meaningful insights. The goal is to ensure **robust quantification** while reducing noise and variability in biological image datasets.

## **Key Applications**
- **Automated data filtering**: Removes extreme values to improve statistical reliability.
- **Threshold optimization**: Dynamically identifies intensity cutoffs for feature detection.
- **Comparative analysis**: Assesses differences between experimental groups using statistical tests.
- **Data visualization**: Generates **publication-ready** plots for reporting findings.

## **Features**
- Loads **raw detection data** from whole-slide image analysis.
- Identifies and removes **outliers** using an adaptive statistical approach.
- Computes an **intensity threshold** for feature segmentation.
- Performs **non-parametric statistical comparisons** to detect significant differences.
- Saves **visualization plots** for easier interpretation of results.

## **Dependencies**
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy'



# **Code to Codons**

### Overview
A Streamlit web application that simulates the conversion of text to DNA, applies mutations, and translates the DNA through RNA into protein sequences.

### Features
- Convert text to DNA sequence.
- Mutate DNA and transcribe into RNA.
- Translate RNA to protein and highlight stop codons.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This project assumes you are using Python Python 3.11.7.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo and navigate into the specific project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`.

### Usage
Input text to convert and mutate into DNA, view the RNA transcription, and the resulting protein sequence with highlighted stop codons.

### Modules
Includes modules for DNA conversion, mutation, RNA transcription, and protein translation.

# **Random**

The "random" folder within this repository contains a variety of projects at different stages of development. Many of these projects are works in progress, undergoing testing, refinement, or expansion. This folder serves as a creative sandbox, reflecting my ongoing exploration and experimentation with new ideas and technologies. While some projects in this folder may not be fully functional or documented, they offer a glimpse into my interests.

# **Just_For_Fun**

This directory contains casual and experimental scripts created for entertainment and exploration.
