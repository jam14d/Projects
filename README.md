## Code to Codons

### Overview
A Streamlit web application that simulates the conversion of text to DNA, applies mutations, and translates the DNA through RNA into protein sequences.

### Features
- Convert text to DNA sequence.
- Mutate DNA and transcribe into RNA.
- Translate RNA to protein and highlight stop codons.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This project assumes you are using Python Python 3.11.7.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo and navigate into the specific project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`.

### Usage
Input text to convert and mutate into DNA, view the RNA transcription, and the resulting protein sequence with highlighted stop codons.

### Modules
Includes modules for DNA conversion, mutation, RNA transcription, and protein translation.
