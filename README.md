## Data Viz  

### Overview  
Data Viz is an interactive learning tool built with Streamlit that helps users explore **random data generation**, **array transformations**, **image processing** **object-oriented programming**. It provides real-time visualizations, explanations, and adjustable parameters to enhance understanding.

### Sections  

#### 1. Exploring Probability: Random Data Generator  
This section allows users to generate and visualize different probability distributions using NumPyâ€™s random module.  
- Select from distributions like Uniform, Normal, Poisson, and more.  
- Adjust sample size and bin count for better visualization.  
- Read explanations on how each distribution works and when to use it.  
- View histograms to analyze the generated data.  
- Observe how the raw numerical data changes depending on selection.
- Calculate argmin() and argmax() and read explanation on its use case.

#### 2. Shape & Shift: NumPy Array Playground  
This section provides an interactive way to create, reshape, and transform NumPy arrays.  
- Generate sequences of numbers based on user-defined sizes.  
- Reshape arrays into different dimensions and see how data is reorganized.  
- Apply transformations like multiplication, addition, and squaring.  
- Compare original and transformed arrays in visual plots.  

#### 3. Code Your Vision: Image Processing & OOP  
This section introduces users to image processing concepts while learning object-oriented programming (OOP).  
- Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG).  
- Extract and visualize individual **Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)** channels.  
- View the numerical array representation of each channel.  
- Learn how images are represented as NumPy arrays.  
- Build an **OOP-based image processor** by implementing a class that:
  - Loads images.
  - Extracts color channels using NumPy.
  - Displays processed images using Matplotlib.  
- Hands-on coding exercises for defining class methods like:
  - `__init__` for initialization.
  - `load_image()` for reading images.
  - `extract_channel()` for isolating color components.
  - `display_channel()` for visualization.

This section blends **computer vision** with **OOP fundamentals**, making it ideal for those looking to practice Python class structures with real-world applications.  

### How to Use  
1. Select a section from the sidebar.  
2. Adjust settings such as sample size, bins, or array dimensions.  
3. View explanations and real-time visualizations.  

### Requirements  
- Python  
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)  
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)  
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)  

### Running the App  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
