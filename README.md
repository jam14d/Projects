## General Applications

## Data Viz  

### Overview  
Data Viz is an interactive learning tool built with Streamlit that helps users explore **random number generation** and **array transformations**. It provides real-time visualizations, explanations, and adjustable parameters to enhance understanding.  

[Live App](https://jam14d-projects-numpy-visualizerapp-7ceorb.streamlit.app/)  

### Sections  

#### 1. Exploring Probability: Random Data Generator  
This section allows users to generate and visualize different probability distributions using NumPyâ€™s random module.  
- Select from distributions like Uniform, Normal, Poisson, and more.  
- Adjust sample size and bin count for better visualization.  
- Read explanations on how each distribution works and when to use it.  
- View histograms to analyze the generated data.  
- Observe how the raw numerical data changes depending on selection.
- Calculate argmin() and argmax() and read explanation on its use case.

#### 2. Shape & Shift: NumPy Array Playground  
This section provides an interactive way to create, reshape, and transform NumPy arrays.  
- Generate sequences of numbers based on user-defined sizes.  
- Reshape arrays into different dimensions and see how data is reorganized.  
- Apply transformations like multiplication, addition, and squaring.  
- Compare original and transformed arrays in visual plots.  

#### 3. Image Channel Extractor  
This section allows users to upload an image and extract its individual Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels.  
- Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG).  
- Extract and visualize the Red, Green, or Blue channels separately.  
- View the numerical array representation of each channel.  
- Gain insight into how images are represented in NumPy arrays.  

### How to Use  
1. Select a section from the sidebar.  
2. Adjust settings such as sample size, bins, or array dimensions.  
3. View explanations and real-time visualizations.  

### Requirements  
- Python  
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)  
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)  
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)  

### Running the App  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Scientific Computing

### Brain Tumor Classification using MRI Scans

#### Overview
Classify MRI scans into:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor (Healthy Brain)**

#### Setup Instructions
- Clone repository or download project files.
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3.10 -m venv brain_tumor_env
source brain_tumor_env/bin/activate
```
- Upgrade pip:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
- Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib tensorflow-macos keras tensorboard tensorflow-estimator tensorflow-metal
```
- Organize dataset from [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).
- Split dataset using provided Python script:
```bash
python split_train_val.py
```

#### Project Goals
