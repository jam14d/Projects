This repository houses a diverse collection of projects, ranging from simple scripts to more complex pipelines and applications. Each project is organized into its respective folder based on its category or functionality. This document highlights one of our notable projects - the DNA and RNA Transcription Pipeline - and provides general information about the status of projects within the "random" folder.

DNA and RNA Transcription Pipeline
Description
The DNA and RNA Transcription Pipeline is designed to convert any given text input into a simulated DNA sequence, which is then transcribed into an RNA sequence. This two-step process involves:

DNA Generation: Converting a string to a DNA sequence.
RNA Transcription: Transcribing the DNA sequence into RNA.
Components
dna_generator.py: Converts a string into a simulated DNA sequence. This script encapsulates the conversion logic, offering a standalone solution for DNA sequence generation from text inputs.

rna_transcriber.py: Transcribes the generated DNA sequence into RNA by replacing all instances of "T" with "U", mimicking biological transcription processes.

Output and Usage
Both the DNA generation and RNA transcription stages allow for the optional saving of outputs as text files. To use this pipeline, ensure dna_generator.py and rna_transcriber.py are located in the same directory. Start by generating a DNA sequence from your input string with dna_generator.py, followed by transcribing this sequence into RNA with rna_transcriber.py.

Random Folder
The "random" folder within this repository contains a variety of projects at different stages of development. Many of these projects are works in progress, undergoing testing, refinement, or expansion. This folder serves as a creative sandbox, reflecting our ongoing exploration and experimentation with new ideas and technologies. While some projects in this folder may not be fully functional or documented, they offer a glimpse into the diverse interests and potential directions for future development.
